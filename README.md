# DVD Rental database analysis
## by Miguel Orellana

This was the first project from Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree covering the block on SQL.

The goal of this project is to query the Sakila DVD Rental database, provided by Udacity. This database holds information about a fictional company that rents movie DVDs.

The goal of the project is to query the database to answer four questions chosen by the student and this way gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. The schema for the DVD Rental database is also provided:
